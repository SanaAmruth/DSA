# Understanding Time Complexity and Feasibility in DSA

## Introduction
In Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm is crucial to determine whether it will run within a reasonable time limit for a given problem. This is typically done using **time complexity analysis**, which helps us estimate how many operations an algorithm will perform for a given input size.

## The 10^9 Rule
A commonly used rule of thumb in competitive programming and DSA is:

> **An algorithm should ideally perform at most 10^8 to 10^9 operations per second to execute within a reasonable time limit.**

This estimation is based on the fact that modern computers can execute roughly **10^8 to 10^9 basic operations per second**.

## Practical Considerations

| Time Complexity | Feasible Input Size (N) | Notes |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| **O(1)**     | Any size (constant time) | Best-case complexity |
| **O(log N)** | Up to 10^18          | Very fast (binary search, etc.) |
| **O(N)**     | Up to 10^7           | Linear time algorithms are efficient |
| **O(N log N)** | Up to 10^6         | Common for sorting (Merge Sort, QuickSort) |
| **O(N^2)**   | Up to 10^4           | Only feasible for small N |
| **O(N^3)**   | Up to 500            | Used for matrix multiplication, DP |
| **O(2^N)**   | Up to 20-25          | Exponential time, brute-force |
| **O(N!)**    | Up to 10             | Factorial growth is infeasible |

## Examples
1. **Sorting an array of size 10^6 using Merge Sort (O(N log N))**  
   - N log N ≈ **10^6 × 20 = 2 × 10^7** operations → **Fast** ✅

2. **Brute force checking all subsets of an array of size 30 (O(2^N))**  
   - 2^30 ≈ **10^9** operations → **Borderline feasible** ⚠️

3. **Using Floyd-Warshall (O(N^3)) on N = 500**  
   - 500^3 = **1.25 × 10^8** operations → **Feasible** ✅

4. **Checking all permutations of N = 12 (O(N!))**  
   - 12! ≈ **4.8 × 10^8** operations → **Feasible but slow** ⚠️

5. **Checking all permutations of N = 15 (O(N!))**  
   - 15! ≈ **1.3 × 10^12** operations → **Not feasible** ❌

## Conclusion
- Always analyze the time complexity before implementing an algorithm.
- Aim for O(N log N) or better for large inputs (N ≈ 10^6).
- If N is small (≤ 100), even O(N^2) or O(N^3) can work.
- Use optimized techniques like **dynamic programming, memoization, and pruning** to handle larger constraints efficiently.

By following these principles, you can design efficient solutions and avoid time-limit exceeded (TLE) errors in competitive programming!
